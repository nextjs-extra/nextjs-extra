# `nextjs-extra`

`nextjs-extra` is a collection of utilities for Next.js.

They have been written originally for different projects, and now they are being published together with proper testing and documentation.

If you have some cool library that you think it would fit here, please open an issue to add it.

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [https://docs.nextjs-extra.org](https://docs.nextjs-extra.org).
