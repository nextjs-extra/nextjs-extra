# Contributing with Documentation

## Small changes and additions

If you want to add something or make a small change, from fixing a typo, to rephrasing a sentence, you can just open a PR.

## Big changes

If you want to make a big change, like adding a new section, or reorganizing the documentation, please open an issue first, so we can discuss it.

## Documentation for users

The documentation for users it in the [docs](https://github.com/nextjs-extra/nextjs-extra/docs) folder, and it's written in Markdown.

## Documentation for contributors

The documentation for contributors is in the `docs/contributing-guidelines` folder, and it's written in Markdown.

Also, we use JSDOC comments in the code, to generate documentation for the contributors.

## Translations

We are open to translations, but we don't have a process for it yet.

If you want to translate the documentation, please open an issue first, so we can discuss it.
