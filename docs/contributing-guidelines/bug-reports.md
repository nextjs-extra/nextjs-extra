# Bug Reporting

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We appreciate your help in improving the software and making it better for everyone.

Below are some guidelines for reporting bugs in the project:

1. **Check the existing issues:** Before you create a new issue, please search the existing issues to see if the bug has already been reported. This helps to avoid duplicates and keeps the issue tracker organized. Also, there might be some workarounds and solutions in the issues, that could help you.
2. **Reproduce the problem:** If you can, please try to reproduce the problem in a minimal environment. This will help us isolate the problem and identify the cause.
3. **Use a clear and descriptive title:** A good title should concisely describe the problem you are experiencing. This makes it easier for others to understand and follow the issue, and also to help others find the issue in the future.
4. **Provide a clear and concise description of the issue:** Include as much information as possible about the problem you are experiencing, including the steps to reproduce the issue. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to identify and fix the problem.
5. **Include any relevant logs or error messages:** If you are experiencing an error, please include the full error message in the issue description. This will help us understand what is causing the problem.
6. **Include screenshots and animated GIFs:** If applicable, include screenshots or animated GIFs to help explain the problem. This will make it easier for us to understand the issue.
