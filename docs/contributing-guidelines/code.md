# Contributing with code

## Communication

All the communication takes place openly and publically on the GitHub: issues, PRs, Discussions, etc.

It's ok to use private communication channels to discuss things, but please keep the public channels updated.

What has only been discussed outside GitHub does not exist.

## Steps

You should only work on an open issue, that has not been assigned to anyone:

- If you want to work on an issue, please comment on it, and we will assign it to you.
- If you want to work on something that is not an issue, please open an issue first, and we will discuss it.

### First time contributions:

- fork the repo
- clone your fork
- create a branch for your changes
- make your changes
- make sure you have updated the tests
- make sure you have updated the documentation
- push your changes to your fork
- open a PR

If your PR is accepted, you will be added to the project's contributors, and you will be able to push directly to the repo the next time.

Anyway, don't be worry, I will guide you through the process.

### Project contributors:

- make sure you are up-to-date with the main branch
- create a branch for your changes
- make your changes
- make sure you have updated the tests
- make sure you have updated the documentation
- push your changes
- open a PR

## Pretty code

Prettification is only done when a new version is released, and it's done by the maintainers.

Please avoid any prettification so that your PR only brings meaningful changes.

## Tests

All code should be covered by tests, we aim for 100% coverage, but don't overdo it with tests that are not useful.

## Documentation

Please, add at least some minimal viable documentation, and keep a clear separation between the documentation for the users and the documentation for the contributors.
