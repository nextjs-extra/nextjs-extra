# Join Us

Next-js extra welcomes all contributions, be it code, documentation, bug reports, feature requests, feedback, or even just a friendly hello.

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/nextjs-extra/nextjs-extra) to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to accept pull requests.

But before you start, please read the following guidelines.

Thank you for your support!

## Scope and limitations

The scope of Next-js extra is to provide a better development experience to teams using Next.js (developers, QAs, product owners, designers) and to make it easier for them to deliver richer-featured web applications.

If any of the libraries and tools we provide can be used with other frameworks, the better, but we don't make our code more complex to be framework-agnostic.

There are two limitations:

- Not use undocumented Next.js APIs
- Not override Next.js APIs

## Code of conduct

Just remember we are all humans, and we all make mistakes. We are all here to help each other, and to learn from each other.

Leave at the door anything unrelated to the project, and be respectful to everyone.

If you have any doubt, just follow the Empathic Version of the Golden Rule:

> Treat others as you honestly think they would like to be treated.
